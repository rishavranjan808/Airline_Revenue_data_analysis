# Airline_Revenue_Data_Analysis
Welcome to the Aircraft Occupancy and Profitability Analysis project. This repository contains the analysis report for a project aimed at addressing the profitability challenges faced by an airline company. The project leverages SQL for data analysis and Python for data cleaning to gain insights into factors affecting occupancy rates and overall profitability.

## Business Problem
Our company operates a diverse fleet of aircraft, ranging from small business jets to medium-sized machines. Despite providing high-quality air transportation services, we are currently facing profitability challenges due to:

Stricter environmental regulations

Higher flight taxes

Rising fuel prices

Increased labour costs due to a tight labour market

To address these issues, conducted an in-depth database analysis to identify opportunities to increase occupancy rates, which can help boost the average profit earned per seat.

## Key Analyses and Findings
Aircraft Capacity: Analyzed aircraft with more than 100 seats to understand capacity distribution.

Ticket Bookings and Revenue Trends: A line chart analysis showed a gradual increase in ticket bookings from June 22nd to July 7th, followed by stable bookings until August, with peaks in bookings correlating with revenue increases.

Fare Conditions: Compared average fares across different fare classes (business, economy, comfort) for each aircraft. Notably, comfort class was only available on the 773 aircraft, while CN1 and CR2 only offered economy class.

## Occupancy Rate Analysis
Revenue Metrics: Analyzed total revenue per year and average revenue per ticket for each aircraft. Aircraft SU9 generated the highest revenue, potentially due to its lower fare prices, while CN1 generated the least, possibly due to offering only economy class at a very low price.

Occupancy Rates: Evaluated the average booked seats relative to total seats to determine occupancy rates for each aircraft.

Impact of Increased Occupancy: Simulated a 10% increase in occupancy rates to assess potential revenue gains, indicating that optimized pricing strategies could gradually increase revenue.

## Conclusion
This analysis has identified key areas where the airline can improve profitability:

Occupancy Rates: Higher occupancy rates correlate with increased profitability, emphasizing the need to optimize pricing strategies and operational efficiency.

Pricing Strategy: The analysis suggests revising ticket prices based on aircraft conditions and facilities to attract more customers without undervaluing services.

Customer Experience: Maintaining a balance between profitability and customer satisfaction is crucial. Enhancing the overall customer experience could lead to higher loyalty and occupancy rates.
